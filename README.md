# objkt-Giveaways 🎁💎

Welcome to **objkt-Giveaways**, the digital playground where generative art meets gratitude — crafted in code, dropped for free, and made to celebrate the real ones: my supporters.

## 🎨✨ What’s the Deal?

This repository holds the magic behind a wild collection of **generative NFTs** on [objkt.com](https://objkt.com/collections/KT1FnuPJx8znHtaN5xKpvA9LfqRkakebSyeh) — pixel-perfect chaos created with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, gifted away as a token of appreciation.

## 💻 Why “Giveaways”?

Because this isn’t just a collection — it’s a love letter to the community.
No hype, no hustle, just genuine thanks expressed through code-based art. Each piece is unique, live-coded, and made to bring joy, not gas fees.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

* **Generative art scripts** that bring each NFT to life
* Code that’s meant to be played with, forked, and celebrated
* A showcase of how pure code can turn into visual storytelling

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **JavaScript**: The mastermind behind the randomness
* **HTML & CSS**: Styling the glitches with flair
* **❤️**: The heart of every token

## 🚨 Heads Up

These giveaways weren’t minted for show — they were created to share. But if you want to show off your objkt-Giveaway piece? Go right ahead. I’m here for it.
